Purpose
============================

This directory contains explanations of how to implement various features in Zikula 2.0, especially if you are migrating from previous versions of Zikula. I wrote this guide as I worked through upgrading some of my modules. Currently, it is not in any order, just what I came across as I worked on upgrading my modules.

For this cookbook, I will call my example module FooModule and all examples will go off of that. You should replace FooModule with whatever your module is called. The namespace I will use is the one I use for all my modules, namely, Paustian. You will see this in the implementation of all the the example files.
