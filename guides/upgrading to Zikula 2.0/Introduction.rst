Purpose
============================

This directory contains explanations of how to implement various features in Zikula 2.0, especially if you are migrating from previous versions of Zikula. I wrote this guide as I worked through upgrading some of my modules. Currently, it is not in any order, just what I came across as I worked on upgrading my modules.
